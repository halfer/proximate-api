# A Docker build file for "proximate-api" proxy control service
#
# PHP in the container takes it merely to 20M or so, but Supervisor requires
# Python, and this bumps it up to 66M.
#
# A build server would negate the need for Composer and its dependencies, but the approach
# of building in the container is fine for now.
